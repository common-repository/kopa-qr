The customer simply clicks on a link or scans a QR code and chooses the automatic payment. From any surface – website, TV, magazine, billboard, flyer, physical store… Fast, Simple, Enjoyable. Wherever there is a QR code, it’s a point of sale. Unique interactive omnichannel experience.

On your end, things are automatically organized and updated. You get payment confirmation and details about where and to whom to deliver a service or merchandise.

But above all, you can do it with absolute safety and confidence because KÖPA complies with global data security standards.

= High-tech solutions =

As a company, we made a highly secured system and got certified PCI DSS Level 1 hosting not only for card data!

To put it simply, the PCI DSS Level 1 is a set of requirements to ensure that companies that store, transmit or process credit card data to the highest standards.  PCI DSS Level 1 is the highest level of compliance. This describes any merchant, processing over 6 million Visa transactions per year.
